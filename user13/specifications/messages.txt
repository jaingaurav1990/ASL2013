This document specifies the layout of the strings the server accepts.
>>> denotes the message the client sends.
<<< denotes the answer one would expect on success.

[User creation]
To create a user send the following string to the server. It will return
the id of the new user as a string.
>>> "register\n"
<<< "OK\nid:{id|int}"

[Queue manipulation]
This string creates a queue named {name} and will return the id which represents
this queue.
>>>"create\nname:{name|string}"
<<<"OK\nid:{id|int}

To delete a queue:
>>>"delete\nid:{id|int}"
<<<"OK\n"

[Messages]
To send a message use the following string, context and receiver are optional

>>>"send\nsender:{sender|int};queue:{queue|int,list of int};priority:{priority|int};message:{message|string};context:{context|int};receiver:{receiver|int}"

The following string lets you peek at a message, again the last three arguments are optional and will only be in the answer
if they are set.

>>>"get\nqueue:{queue|int};context:{context|int};receiver:{receiver|int};by_priority:{by_priority|boolean}"
<<<"OK\nsender:{sender|int};queue:{queue|int,list of int};priority:{priority|int};message:{message|string};context:{context|int};receiver:{receiver|int}"

The following string consumes a string, again same arguments as before

>>>"read\nqueue:{queue|int};context:{context|int};receiver:{receiver|int};by_priority:{by_priority|boolean}"
<<<"OK\nsender:{sender|int};queue:{queue|int,list of int};priority:{priority|int};message:{message|string};context:{context|int};receiver:{receiver|int}"

[Queue querying]

To list all queues use the following string

>>>"list\n"
<<<"OK\nqueues:{queues|list of int}"

To list all queues with messages for a recipient

>>>"list\nreceiver:{receiver}"
<<<"OK\nqueues:{ids|list of int}"
